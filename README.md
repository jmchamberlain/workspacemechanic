# workspacemechanic
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/workspacemechanic

This is from an old archived Eclipse plugin developed by Google. I imported it from Google Code here:
https://code.google.com/archive/a/eclipselabs.org/p/workspacemechanic

If you somehow came across this page, you probably want the plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace. You can find it here:
https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/workspace-mechanic

At this point, I'm basically just playing with the code.
